            Called by various names such as pilaf or pulav, Vegetable Pulao is one of the most common rice dishes in India, the other being Veg Biryani.

            A Veg Pulao is basically an easy rice based dish made with spices, herbs and vegetables in a pot. Additionally there are non-vegetarian versions of pulao too.
            You will find many different vegetarian pulao recipes on the blog including Peas Pulao, Kashmiri Pulao, Tawa Pulao, Paneer Pulao and more.

            However the recipe I’m sharing now is my absolute favorite and how I almost always end up making it.
            What I like best about making this veg pulao recipe, is that it comes together quickly. Use a food processor for chopping the veggies and it will come together super quickly.
            In fact, you only need about 15 minutes of prep time and 25 minutes of cook time to get this cozy dinner on the table!
